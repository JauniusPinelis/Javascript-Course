1. What is Scrum? It is a project management system.
2. You can get certifications to be come a professional Scrum Expert.
Scrum topics:

Scrum Strengths: 
    Estimation: product owners can estimate and promise certain features for shareholders.
    Visibility: the development process is clearly visible to shareholders.

Roles:
    Developer: Traditional developer who are responsible for software implementation
    Product owner: Maintaining the backlog, prioritising tasks and communicating between shareholder and developers.
    Scrum master: The person who is responsible that the best Scrum practice are followed.
    Stakeholder: person who has interest in the product.

Key elements:
    Backlog: a list of tasks that need to be implemented.
    Product (project): the software that is being developed.
    Epic: Big feature which consists of several user stories. 
        Epic may take several sprints to complete.
    User Story: Feature that needs to be implemented. 
        It should not be a big task and it should be well documented.
        Story should fit into a single sprint.
    Sprint: an iteration of how often the software is updated. Usually sprint is 2 weeks. 
    Stories should be implemented by the end of the sprint.
    Grooming(or Refinement): Review/estimation/splitting of the ideas/epics/stories.


Refinement:
    0. One of the aims of refinement is that whole team understands the tasks.
    1. Divide tasks/epics into smaller completable tasks.
    2. Identity issues, blockers, uncertainties.

Estimation
    Estimation is one of the most complex parts.
    Estimation is difficult.
    There is no single best technique of how to estimate.
    By default developers do relative estimation by hours
    Usually developer has a 8-hour work day, but not all time is spent on development (documentation, meetings and etc)
    Pessimistic estimation: add extra effort for uncertainties and issues.
    Quite often Story Points are used for estimation.
    Story points are measured by effort, complexity and risk. They are done by comparing the previous tasks.
    With story points (or hours) you can measure the 'Capacity' of the team.
    Every sprint product owner remeasure the capacity of the teams (of how much story point the team can get).
    Together with estimation, capacity of teams, well-groomed backlog and priorities we can plan features way ahead.
    Scrum allows to make more calculated and estimated promises to deliver to shareholders.
    Planning poker is common technique to get accurate estimates.

Planning:
    The planning happens before every start of the sprint.
    purpose of the planning is to move the tasks from backlog and starting the sprint.
    Big discussion of which tasks should go into the sprint. 
    The tasks get ordered in the sprint.
    Developer team should be self-managing.
    Sometimes developers assign the tasks to themselves in the planning. 
    But the tasks should be assigned as sprint is runnings.
    The team makes a commitment that the tasks in the sprint will be completed.
    The team also defined the sprint goal.

Sprint review (demo session):
    Demonstrate what has been completed in this sprint.
    It is important to share the knowledge of the product to product owner and shareholders.
    Feedback and discussion are welcome.
    Quite often this bit is skipped.

Retrospective:
    Very important meeting for developers to reflect how the sprint has gone and if something can be improved.
    The process is similar to planning poker: You are give a period of time (usually 10 minutes)
    to write about the following topics: 
        1. What went well.
        2. What did not go well.
        3. What can be improved?
        4. What is sabotaging the progress (what you did not like).
    After 10 minutes the writing are revealed.
    Quite often these writings are made anonymous. 
    These writings (cards) get grouped and get discussed.

    In this meeting, action items should be recorded.
    In the next retro, these action items are reviewed.

Daily standup:
    This is one short meeting (usually 15 minutes) with no big discussions.
    Every developer, product owner goes in a circle and state:
        1. What they have been working on yesterday.
        2. What they are going to do today.
        3. Any blockers?
        4. Any issues?
