Kanban:
    Similar development framework to Scrum.
    Less emphasis on planning and sprints.
    More suited for tasks that are hard to estimate.
    Simplier process than scrum
    No sprints, work happens per work-item basis.
    Developers have limit on how many work-items can be in progress.
    It is very flexible. No prescribed roles or ceremonies.

Sometimes companies actually do Kanban even though they official say they are doing Scrum.
Trello seems to be a very good tool for Kanban.

Agile Development (Extreme programming):
    Alternative to Waterfall model.
    Pre-Scrum framework that uses iterative development.
    Based on frequent deliveries.
    Uses visual tools for visibility.
